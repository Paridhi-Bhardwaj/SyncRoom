# SyncRoom
![]</br>
SyncRoom is a full-stack, real-time chat application designed for instant and private communication. It allows users to sign up, log in, create chatrooms, and engage in live conversations with others. The project features a modern, responsive frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS, and a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express, and Prisma with a PostgreSQL database. Real-time functionality is handled seamlessly with Socket.io.

## ✨ Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system with password hashing (`bcryptjs`).
- **JWT Authorization**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (Access and Refresh Tokens) for securing API endpoints. Refresh tokens are stored in `HttpOnly` cookies for enhanced security.
- **Chatroom Management**:
  - Users can create new chatrooms with a name and description.
  - A unique, shareable link is generated for each new chatroom.
  - Users can join chatrooms they are invited to.
  - View a personalized dashboard of all joined chatrooms.
  - Leave/delete chatrooms from the dashboard.
- **Real-Time Communication**:
  - Live messaging within chatrooms powered by **Socket.io**.
  - Real-time notifications when users join a room.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and dark-themed interface built with **Tailwind CSS** that works seamlessly on all screen sizes.
- **RESTful API**: A well-structured backend API for managing users, chatrooms, and messages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual database connection string and a secure secret.

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME"
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    This will set up the database schema based on the Prisma model.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and consists of four models:

-   **`User`**: Stores user credentials and personal information.
-   **`Chatroom`**: Contains details about each chatroom, including its name, creator, and a JSON array of current members.
-   **`UserChatroom`**: A many-to-many relation table connecting users to the chatrooms they've joined. It ensures a user can only join a specific chatroom once (`@@unique([userId, chatroomId])`).
-   **`message`**: Stores all messages for a given chatroom. The `content` field is a JSON array where each element represents a single message object (`{message, user_id, username, timestamp}`).

Relationships are set up with `onDelete: Cascade` to ensure that when a `User` or `Chatroom` is deleted, all related `UserChatroom` and `message` entries are also automatically removed, maintaining data integrity.

## 📡 API Endpoints
